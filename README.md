# Poisson Distribution in Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning assignment focusing on the Poisson distribution and its applications in calculus.

## The Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, assuming these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.

### Key Characteristics:
- Used to model rare events
- Events are independent
- Characterized by a single parameter (位), which is the average rate of occurrence

### Formula:
The probability of observing k events in an interval is given by the equation:

P(X = k) = (e^(-位) * 位^k) / k!

Where:
- e is Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)
- 位 (lambda) is the average number of events per interval
- k is the number of events we want to calculate the probability for

## Applications

The Poisson distribution is widely used in various fields, including:

1. Coffee Shop Arrivals
2. Quality control: Analyzing the number of defects in a production line
3. Biology: Studying the number of mutations in a DNA sequence
4. Finance: Modeling the number of trades per day in a stock market

## Assignment Tasks

This assignment involves:

1. Implementing the Poisson distribution formula in Python
2. Analyzing real-world datasets using the Poisson distribution
3. Visualizing the results using matplotlib or seaborn
4. Discussing the implications of the Poisson distribution in machine learning contexts
